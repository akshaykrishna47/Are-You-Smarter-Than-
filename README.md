# Are You Smarter Than? (AYST)

## Project Description

Are You Smarter Than? (AYST) is a React-based trivia quiz game inspired by educational challenge shows. Players select a difficulty level and answer a series of randomly selected multiple-choice questions to test their knowledge.

The game features three difficulty levels:

* 5 Year Old
* 8th Grader
* Scholar

Players must answer five questions correctly to win. Questions and answer choices are randomized each game, and progress is automatically saved using session storage so users can continue after refreshing the page.
